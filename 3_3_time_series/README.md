 Implement your own line chart with a different dataset than the one used in our demo. It can be the same dataset that you leveraged in the time series tutorial of section 2.

Add dots (<circle>) at each data point on your line. These dots should have an enter and update transition, similar to how we implemented transitions in the previous tutorial (section 3 tutorial 2).

Make intentional design decisions -- colors, sizes, axes, transitions, etc. should illustrate something interesting about or relevant to your data.
