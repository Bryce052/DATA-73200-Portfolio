For this tutorial, I converted the vertical bar graph (class demo) into a horizontal bar chart. 
This graph reported violent, property, and combined crime totals for the cities of New York, Boston, Atlanta, Portland, Seattle, and San Francisco from 2020 to 2021. 
Labels were added to each bar and a color scale was used to differentiate between the types of crimes being reported (violent, property, and combined). 
Finally, a chart title 'Crime Breakdown for Select US Cities (2020 - 2021)' was added alongside information regarding the creation of the graph. 
The web page can be accessed via https://bryce052.github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2022/2_1_quantities_and_amounts
A screenshot of the web page has also been uploaded to this repository.
