For this tutorial, I implemented a scatter plot with a different dataset than the one used in our demo.
Size the dots by something data related. This requires creating a new scale. Carefully consider the domain and range of this new scale, and do your best to make the domain of the scale dynamic (i.e. would the scale still work if the data changed?).
Make intentional design decisions -- colors, sizes, axes, etc. should illustrate something interesting about or relevant to your data.
