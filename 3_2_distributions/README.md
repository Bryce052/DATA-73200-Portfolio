 Implement your own scatter plot with a different dataset than the one used in our demo. This means your dropdowns will have different values, which correspond to your data.

Implement a different transition than the one used in the demo (i.e., your dots should not move from left to center to right on transitions). Consider other visible properties that could change as an object is entering, exiting, etc. and what that change suggests about the state of that data point.

Make intentional design decisions -- colors, sizes, axes, transitions, etc. should illustrate something interesting about or relevant to your data.
