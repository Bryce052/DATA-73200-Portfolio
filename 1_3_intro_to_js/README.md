For this tutorial, I created a web page that counts the number of times a user clicks a certain button. 
The page starts with 0 in the counter display and the user is provided with the option to select a position (+) or negative (-) button. 
The button runs an onclick function that updates the number in the counter (can be positive or negative dependent on the interaction of the user).
