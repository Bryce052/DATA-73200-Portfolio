For this tutorial, I created a web page that counts the number of times a user clicks a certain button. 
The page starts with 0 in the counter display and the user is provided with the option to select a position (+) or negative (-) button. 
The button runs an onclick function that updates the number in the counter (can be positive or negative dependent on the interaction of the user).
The web page can be accessed via https://bryce052.github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2022/1_3_intro_to_js
A screenshot of the web page has also been uploaded to this repository.
