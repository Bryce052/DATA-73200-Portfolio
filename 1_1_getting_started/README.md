For this first tutorial, I updated the language in the demo index.html file.
This file reads 'Hello World' 'This is the first tutorial assignment' 'For DATA 73200 at CUNY GC'.
I then updated the style of the web page including the text size and color. 
Finall I embedded the CUNY GC logo in the bottom left hand corner of the web page.
