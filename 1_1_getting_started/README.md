For this first tutorial, I updated the language in the demo index.html file.
This file reads 'Hello World' 'This is the first tutorial assignment' 'For DATA 73200 at CUNY GC'.
I then updated the style of the web page including the text size and color. 
Finally, I embedded the CUNY GC logo in the bottom left hand corner of the web page. 
The created web page can be accessed via https://bryce052.github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2022/1_1_getting_started
A screenshot of the web page has also been uploaded to this repository.
