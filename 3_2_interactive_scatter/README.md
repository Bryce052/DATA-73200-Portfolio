For this tutorial, I created a scatter plot with a different dataset than the one used in the class demo. 
Using neighborhood data from the Portland Police Bureau (2021), this graph included variables such as the estimated population, number of police officers, total violent and property crimes reported to law enforcement. These variables were included in dropdown menus on the x- and y-axes for the user to select from (resulting in a change in the presented scatter plot). 
Each of the neighborhoods were assigned a unique color in accordance to their location in Portland (North, Northwest, Northeast, South, Southwest, and Southeast). 
The dots (representing neighborhoods) were then sized in accordance to their total area (in square miles). 
Finally, a tooltip was added to the scatter graph to allow the user to hover over each dot and be presented with the values (corresponding with the selected variables in the dropdown menus). 
The created web page can be accessed via https://bryce052.github.io/DATA-73200-Portfolio/3_2_interactive_scatter/
A screenshot of the web page has also been uploaded to this repository.
