mplement your own bar chart with a different dataset than the one used in our demo. It can be the same dataset you used in the section 2 version of this same tutorial.
Add axes or labels to this chart, as we learned in other tutorials of the previous section.
Add a color scale to this chart, as we learned in other tutorials of the previous section.
Make intentional design decisions -- colors, sizes, axes, transitions, etc. should illustrate something interesting about or relevant to your data.
