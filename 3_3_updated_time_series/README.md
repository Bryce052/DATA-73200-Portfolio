For this tutorial, I updated tutorial 2_3 (time series area chart) with an interactive multi-line chart. 
Using a different dataset than the previous tutorial, the line graph showed the combined reported crime for the Downtown, Hazelwood, and 
Northwest districts from September 1st to September 30th. For each of the lines (representing the count of crime for each neighborhood over time), dots were 
added to present the exact number of crimes reported to police. A tooltip was then added to allow the user to hover over each of these dots (representing days in 
September) to be presented with the corresponding count of crimes. Lines were also color coded in accordance to the neighborhood that was being represented. 
Finally, axis titles were added to the graph alongside a chart title and description.
