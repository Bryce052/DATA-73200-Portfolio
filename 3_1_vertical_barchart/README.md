For this tutorial, I created a vertical bar chart using a different dataset than the one used in the class demo. 
Using data provided by the Portland Police Bureau (2021), various crime types (sex crimes, drug crimes, property crimes, and violent crimes) were reported for a selection of neighborhoods in the city (including the Northwest, Hazelwood, Pearl, Downtown, Linnton, and St. Johns). 
Axes were added to the graph and included the number of crimes (y-axis) and name of the Portland neighborhood (x-axis).
A color scale was used for the different crime types (in the bar graph and legend). 
The legend was made interactive to the user by offering the ability to select the type of crime - the result of one or more selections by the user was a change in the bars presented in the graph. 
The created web page can be accessed via https://bryce052.github.io/DATA-73200-Portfolio/3_1_vertical_barchart/
A screenshot of the web page has also been uploaded to this repository.
