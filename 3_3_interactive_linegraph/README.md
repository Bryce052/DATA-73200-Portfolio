For this tutorial, I created a multi-line chart using a different dataset than the class demo. 
Using neighborhood-level data provided by the Portland Police Bureau (2020), the line graph showed the total reported crime for the Downtown, Hazelwood, and Northwest districts from September 1st to September 30th. 
For each of the lines (representing the count of crime for each neighborhood over time), dots were added to present the exact number of crimes reported to police. 
A tooltip was then added to allow the user to hover over each of these dots (representing days in September) to be presented with the corresponding count of crimes. 
Lines were also color coded in accordance to the neighborhood that was being represented. 
For these neighborhoods, an interactive legend was created that allows the user to select one or more of the neighborhoods and be presented with the line(s) that corresponds with that selection. 
Finally, axis titles were added to the graph alongside a chart title and description. 
The created web page can be accessed via https://bryce052.github.io/DATA-73200-Portfolio/3_3_interactive_linegraph/
A screenshot of the web page has been uploaded to this repository.
