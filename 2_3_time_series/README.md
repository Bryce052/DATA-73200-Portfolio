For this tutorial, I created an area graph using a different dataset than the class demo. 
Using data provided by city governments (May 2020 - December 2020), the graph shows the number of crimes reported to law enforcement in select US Cities including Portland (OR), Seattle (WA), Los Angeles (CA), San Francisco (CA), and Boise (ID). 
Each of the cities were then color coded to show their proportion of the total number of crimes over time relative to other cities. 
A title and description of the chart was then added to the web page.
