For this tutorial, I made an HTML table with at least one more column than the sample code and class demo. 
The columns included variables such as the city and state with corresponding population and crime estimates (violent crime, property crime, and combined crime).
The rows included the cities of Portland (OR), Seattle (WA), Philadelphia (PA), Boston (MA), and Dallas (TX).
I then used crime and population estimates provided by these city governments. 
Finally, I added two svgs and a choropleth map to the web page.
